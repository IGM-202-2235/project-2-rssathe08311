### Student Info

-   Name: Reva Sathe
-   Section: 02

## Simulation Design

This simulation will be based off of a post-apocolyptic zombie-like comic I made during high school. There will be shadow-like creatures that hunt down the main character as he tries to avoid them and fight them. 

### Controls

-   _List all of the actions the player can have in your simulation_
    -   _Include how to preform each action ( keyboard, mouse, UI Input )_
    -   _Include what impact an action has in the simulation ( if is could be unclear )_

## Agent 1 - Leo

A super powered human adept at fighting off Shades in a post-apocolyptic world.

### _State 1 Name_ 

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
   - _If behavior has input data list it here_
   - _eg, Flee - nearest Agent2_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_
   - _eg, When this agent gets within range of Agent2_
   - _eg, When this agent has reached target of State2_
   
### _State 2 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_

## Agent 2 - Shades
Shadowy creatures that resemble husks of humans that are out to attack any living being. Though they are vunerable to attacks themseleves much like zombies._

### _State 1 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_
   
### _State 2 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_

## Sources

-   _List all project sources here –models, textures, sound clips, assets, etc._
-   _If an asset is from the Unity store, include a link to the page and the author’s name_

## Make it Your Own

- _List out what you added to your game to make it different for you_
- _If you will add more agents or states make sure to list here and add it to the documention above_
- _If you will add your own assets make sure to list it here and add it to the Sources section
  
This project is entirely based off of a webcomic I created in highschool. 
- I will be drawing all the art assets for sprites, backgrounds, and obstacles. 
- I may potentially add in a third agent so that the world is more lively. 

## Known Issues

_List any errors, lack of error checking, or specific information that I need to know to run your program_

### Requirements not completed

_If you did not complete a project requirement, notate that here_
